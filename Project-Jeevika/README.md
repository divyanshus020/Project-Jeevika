# 🚀 Jeevika - Connecting Small Businesses with Talent

**Jeevika** is a professional networking platform designed to bridge the gap between small businessmen, merchants, and potential employees. Unlike conventional job portals, Jeevika operates similarly to LinkedIn but caters specifically to small-scale businesses seeking skilled workers, freelancers, and employees.

The platform enables business owners to create profiles, post job opportunities, and connect with professionals looking for employment. Job seekers can showcase their skills and experience, making it easier for employers to find the right candidates. Jeevika also integrates smart recommendations, messaging features, and a user-friendly dashboard to streamline the hiring process.

With a mission to empower small businesses and job seekers, Jeevika simplifies recruitment, reduces hiring costs, and promotes local employment opportunities efficiently.
